# Campus Placement Prediction Web App

## Overview

This Flask web application leverages machine learning models to predict campus placements based on user-provided input. It provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for users to input relevant features, such as academic performance, gender, work experience, and more. The application then processes these inputs through a trained machine learning model to generate predictions regarding the likelihood of placement.

## Features

- Predict campus placements using a machine learning model.
- User-friendly interface for inputting details.
- Responsive design for a seamless user experience.
